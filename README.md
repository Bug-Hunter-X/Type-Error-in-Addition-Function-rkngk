# JavaScript Type Error Bug

This repository demonstrates a common type error in JavaScript and its solution.

The `bug.js` file contains a function `foo` that adds two numbers. However, it doesn't perform sufficient type checking, leading to a potential runtime error if non-numeric values are passed as arguments.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust type handling to prevent this type of error.
